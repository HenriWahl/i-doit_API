    Enable documenting "special methods" using the autodoc_ extension.

    Refer to :func:`enable_special_methods()` to enable the use of this
    function (you probably don't want to call
    :func:`special_methods_callback()` directly).

    This function implements a callback for ``autodoc-skip-member`` events to
    include documented "special methods" (method names with two leading and two
    trailing underscores) in your documentation. The result is similar to the
    use of the ``special-members`` flag with one big difference: Special
    methods are included but other types of members are ignored. This means
    that attributes like ``__weakref__`` will always be ignored (this was my
    main annoyance with the ``special-members`` flag).

    The parameters expected by this function are those defined for Sphinx event
    callback functions (i.e. I'm not going to document them here :-).
